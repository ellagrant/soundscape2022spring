"On a Winter's Night" by Ella Grant

My soundscape is titled "On a Winter's Night." It takes the listener on am eerie, disorienting journey as our main character, after realizing she does 
not know where she is or how she got there, encounters a frightening stranger. My soundscape is supposed to evoke the feeling of a dream, or in this case, 
a nightmare. Many of the sounds you hear, like the car horn, the dialogue, and the music at the end are edited to sound like distorted, exaggerated versions
of how they would sound in real life. The strange man that our character meets and tries to ask for help speaks in incoherent, cryptic phrases, and at one
point starts speaking in reverse. My soundscape concludes with the main character and her friend, who previously disappeared into "the store" that the main
character can't see, running away from the strange man as the music swells. As they are running, an alarm clock sounds. I wasn't sure if I wanted to 
reveal that this was supposed to be a dream or let the audience interpret it freely, but I feel my inclusion of the alarm clock sound works well with the
overall narrative since the alarm sounds shrill and unnerving.

My main goal for this project was to create suspense and evoke feelings of anxiety within the audience through sound. I hope that the audience is able to 
have somewhat of a grasp on the narrative itself, but understanding what's going on wasn't my top priority since the plot itself is absurd. In my repository,
you can find my commit history, assets, credits, and screenshots of my work in progress. I hope you enjoy exploring the auditory dreamscape of 
"On a Winter's Night"!
